**[{{UPSTREAM_TITLE}}](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/releases/tag/{{UPSTREAM_TAG}})**, unmodified, with **rapidraw-web v{{WEB_VERSION}}**: it runs on a machine on your network and you use it from your browser. For what's new in the editor itself, see the RapidRAW release linked above.

### What's new in rapidraw-web v{{WEB_VERSION}}
{{RRWEB_CHANGES}}

### Downloads
Install on the computer that has your photos and the GPU; open it from any browser on your network.

| OS | Download | |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** 10/11, x64 | `…_windows_x64-setup.exe` | All-in-one installer. Start *RapidRAW Web Bridge* from the Start menu. |
| **macOS**, Apple Silicon | `…_macos_arm64.dmg` | All-in-one app (experimental). Not notarized: the first time, right-click the app → *Open* (or *System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway*). |
| **macOS**, Intel | `…_macos_x64.dmg` | Same as above. |
| **Linux**, x64 | `…_linux_x64.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu), `.rpm` (Fedora/openSUSE) **or** `.AppImage` (any distro) | All-in-one, one file. Desktop: start *RapidRAW Web Bridge* from the menu. Server without a screen: `systemctl --user enable --now rapidraw-web`. |
| **Linux**, arm64 | `…_linux_arm64.deb` / `.rpm` / `.AppImage` | Same as above. |
| Linux, optional | `…_linux_server.tar.gz` | Relay + web UI with `run.sh`, for Docker or starting the parts yourself (needs Node.js 20+ and a bridge package). |

Package version: `{{PKG_VERSION}}`, so installing a newer web release over an older one upgrades it, also on the same RapidRAW version.

Setup: [README → Quick start](https://github.com/vedranius/rapidraw-web#quick-start)

### Features
**Editor**: the real RapidRAW interface, every slider rendered by the server's GPU. **Photo library**: chosen once on the server; folder and file pickers in the browser start there. **This computer**: edit photos that stay in a folder on the computer you browse from (copied in the background, or on demand with a Linux server; Chrome/Edge over HTTPS). **Connection badge**: recommends the preview quality for your connection. **Files**: download exports (several files as .zip), upload, create folders, rename, copy, move and delete (to the trash) inside your photo folders; RapidRAW edits travel with their photos.

### Known limitations
One active editing session at a time · pickers only browse the photo folders (other paths can be typed) · desktop-only window features and tethering are not available.
